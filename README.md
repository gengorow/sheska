sheska is a simple little script for adding metadata tags to image files, based
on the tags they're assigned on Sankakuchan, a Gelbooru-style imageboard.

You'll need to install exiftool and put it in your PATH, and move
ExifTool_config to ~/.ExifTool_config. Other than that, sheska should run with
just a somewhat recent version of Python 2.x.

Usage is simple: feed a bunch of filenames to sheska.py. A fair amount of text
will be spit out to tell you what's happening; if you don't like that, redirect
it off to /dev/null with your shell.

[Sheska] is an amazing librarian from Fullmetal Alchemist. While her talents lie
more towards memorizing large quantities of text, I've spent too much time on
[TvTropes] as it is, so I'm counting her as "close enough".
